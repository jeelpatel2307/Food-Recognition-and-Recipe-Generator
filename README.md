### Food Recognition and Recipe Generator

This Java program is a simplified example of a food recognition and recipe generation system. It allows users to input a food item and generates a recipe based on the input. Please note that this program does not involve actual food recognition or complex recipe generation algorithms; it simply matches the input with hard-coded food items and their corresponding recipes.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java program using any Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter a food item when prompted.
4. The program will recognize the food item and display the corresponding recipe, if available.

### Example

If the user enters "pizza," the program will output:

```
Food recognized: pizza
Recipe: Pizza Recipe: Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms)

```

If the user enters a food item not recognized by the program, it will display a message indicating that the food is not recognized.

### Disclaimer

This program is a basic example and does not involve actual food recognition or complex recipe generation algorithms. For a real-world application, you would need to integrate with external APIs or machine learning models for food recognition and access a comprehensive recipe database.
